#  Appliance-Energy-Prediction
 predicting energy consumption (Appliances) using  the multivariate Appliance Energy Prediction Dataset.

This project involves preprocessing energy data, feature engineering, and training a model to analyze the dataset. The steps provided below outline how to set up and run the code, whether using **Jupyter Notebook** or **Google Colab**.

## Project Overview
This assessment focuses on:
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Preprocessin
- Feature Engineering**
- Model Training and Evaluation**

Generated datasets:
- `processed_energy_data.csv`
- `finalized_features.csv`

---

## Setup Instructions
1. **Dependencies**: Ensure all required libraries are installed. Use the `requirements.txt` file:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
2. **Tools**: Ensure you have either:
   - Jupyter Notebook (installed locally)
   - Access to Google Colab (via browser)

## Running the Code

### Using Jupyter Notebook
1. **Setup Environment**:
   - Install the libraries in `requirements.txt`.  
   - Open the terminal, navigate to the project folder, and start Jupyter Notebook:
     ```bash
     jupyter notebook
     ```
2. **File Modifications**:
   - Open `EDA_&_data_preprocessing.ipynb` and:
     - Comment out or remove the line:
       ```python
       drive.mount('/content/drive')
       ```
     - Replace dataset paths (`/content/...`) with the local directory paths:
       - Example:
         ```python
         processed_file_path = "/C:/Users/User/Downloads/processed_energy_data.csv"
         ```
   - Repeat the above step for:
     - `feature_engineering.ipynb`
     - `model_and_train.ipynb`
3. **Run the Code**:
   - In each notebook, select **Run All Cells** or execute cells sequentially.
   - After running:
     - `EDA_&_data_preprocessing.ipynb` → Generates `processed_energy_data.csv`.
     - `feature_engineering.ipynb` → Generates `finalized_features.csv`.
     - `model_and_train.ipynb` → Trains and evaluates the model.

### Using Google Colab
1. **Upload Files**:
   - Upload these files to your Google Drive:
     - `energy_data_set.csv`
     - `EDA_&_data_preprocessing.ipynb`
     - `feature_engineering.ipynb`
     - `model_and_train.ipynb`
2. **Run Notebooks**:
   - Open each notebook in Google Colab.
   - Modify dataset paths if needed (e.g., `/content/drive/...`).
   - Run all cells in order:
     - `EDA_&_data_preprocessing.ipynb` → Generates `processed_energy_data.csv`.
     - `feature_engineering.ipynb` → Generates `finalized_features.csv`.
     - `model_and_train.ipynb` → Trains and evaluates the model.
